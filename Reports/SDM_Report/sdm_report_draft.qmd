# Background

The Northwestern Hub for Bat Population Research and Monitoring (Northwest Bat Hub) began efforts at annual summer occupancy surveys for the 15 endemic bat species to the Pacific Northwest in 2016 as a regional member of the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat). This effort has led to the collection of a robust species occurrence dataset–currently spanning eight years– which has contributed to national efforts to analyze population-level trends at the national level for certain species [@udell]. At a regional level, the Northwest Bat Hub has also produced many publications influencing study design[@reichert2021; @rodhouse2017], data analysis [@irvine2018], and conservation management[@rodhouse2019; @rodhouse2021].

Perhaps one of the greatest challenges of this large-scale, regional monitoring effort is data management. With dozens of individuals across many partnering agencies completing surveys, the Northwest Bat Hub has invested significantly in survey standardization using mobile data collection technologies such as ArcGIS Collector Field Maps and Survey123. Standardization of these surveys has allowed the Bat Hub to build extensive data management protocols and programmatic data pipelines using the popular statistical software ‘R’. At the time of this report, these pipelines address the following needs:

-   Site Metadata Quality Assurance and Control (QA/QC)

-   Acoustic File ‘scrubbing’, attribution, and auto-classification using SonoBat Data Wizard

-   Data preparation for the national NABat data upload, BatAMP, and the Bat Hub’s local metadata storage in a Microsoft Access Database (.accdb)

-   Report generation for partner agencies of the Northwest Bat Hub

Over time, these pipelines and protocols have greatly improved the Bat Hub’s efficiency in annually processing data collected in the field and providing feedback for partnering agencies. Currently, feedback and data insights are provided to partners in three forms: 1) vetted outputs of species occurrence for each sample unit falling under a particular agency’s management jurisdiction (**Figure 1**), 2) partner agency and Pacific Northwest regional annual NABat reports and 3) publication in academic journals using novel methodology derived by the Northwest Bat Hub and its contributors.

Data pipelines and tools like the Northwest Bat Hub Data Viewer help the Bat Hub to meet reporting requirements for its partners, and the Bat Hub’s publications have provided invaluable data insights–particularly for the Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) and the Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus)@rodhouse2019. The statistical methodology used for these publications in many cases have been specifically designed with the NABat sampling strategy in mind, and inferences gleaned using these methods should not be ignored. It is possible, however, that other flexible modeling strategies could be built into the Bat Hub’s pre-existing data pipelines to leverage the Bat Hub’s annual monitoring efforts and give dynamic data insights to partners without the heavy lifting of the publication process. Furthermore, partners of the Northwest Bat Hub are still in need of updated range maps for many bat species of the pacific northwest.

In this report, we will describe our approach to creating range maps for bat species in the three-state region of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) machine learning method. We then demonstrate how our approach can be flexibly implemented as a straight-forward extension to existing Bat Hub protocols. Finally, we discuss how collaborators might interpret and leverage model results in decision-making processes to support bat conservation.

# The Approach

## Why use MaxEnt?

Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are a part of a growing field of spatiotemporal models that leverage advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) @phillips2017a method has become particularly popular due to its ability to handle presence-only data (e.g. the data generated by NABat acoustic monitoring efforts) and its availability through open-source releases of the original java application @phillipsc and approximations in statistical modeling software ‘R’@kass2021a. We propose that we can leverage this openly available software to build a user-friendly extension of the Northwest Bat Hub’s data management pipeline that will efficiently provide visual data insights and summaries to its partners.

Briefly, MaxEnt works to make predictions about the probability of species occurrence across a study area given a set of vetted observations and a set of rasterized explanatory variables, also termed *environmental covariates.* The spatial resolution of the resulting predictions is determined by the spatial resolution of the available environmental covariates. In the context of this report, the study are of interest is the three-state region of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Species observation records were obtained from the Northwest Bat Hub's vetted acoustic monitoring records and environmental covariates (Table 1) were determined through literature review[@udell; @rodhouse2019; @rodhouse2021] and obtained from various sources. An in-depth and explanation and motivation for the use of MaxEnt for ecological modeling purposes can be found in Elith et al., 2011 @elith2011.
